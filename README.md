UPDATE TO POWER KEYS..
In order to remove confusion of what TV supports what power keys.
I have decided to alter the Samsung handling of keys. The way Samsung
had them set up seemed to cause to much confusion. I think that everyone
will like this way better.

KEY_POWER = toggle. This is going to toggle the power. so if the TV is
off it will turn it on. and if it is on it will turn it off.

KEY_POWERON = Discrete power on. this will always turn the TV on
if it is off.

KEY_POWEROFF = You guessed it. Discrete power off. If the TV is on
this will turn it off.


This is a much easier mechanism and a whole lot easier to grasp. so no
matter what TV you have and what key it supports no longer matters.
This is what these keys will do. plain and simple.


PLEASE READ

The library has be updated and added to. There is a plethora of new
features as well as some changes to the old ones.
Be sure to read this documentation in it's entirety.

If you ask a question and the answer is in this documentation the only
thing I am going to say is `Read the documentation`.

So it is my suggestion that you do exactly that before posting any kind
of an issue.

<br></br>

\*\*\*\*\*\*\* LEGACY TV OWNERS (TV's older then 2014) PLEASE READ \*\*\*\*\*\*\*

DO NOT POST AN ISSUE ABOUT THE TV NOT POWERING ON THE TV DOES NOT SUPPORT IT!!!!

**SAMSUNGCTL**
==========
BIG NEWS!!!!
samsungctl now supports the ever elusive H and J model year (2014 and 2015) TV's

<br></br>
I want to give a thanks to the people that helped in the bug testing
of this version. It has been a bit of a challenge because of the different
devices/OS's that samsungctl is running on. In no special order I want to say
TY for the help. If I have missed someone please let me know.

Onto the library.

samsungctl is a library and a command line tool for remote controlling
Samsung televisions via a TCP/IP connection. It currently supports
2008+ TVs with Ethernet or Wi-Fi connectivity. That includes the
H and J model year TV's as well as the TV's that have the latest
Samsung firmware that makes use of an SSL based websocket connection.

On all TV's you will be prompted to accept the connection this prompt
gets displayed ON THE TV. You will have 30 seconds to do this before it
errors out. There is a slight variation to this, on 2014 and 2015 year
TV's (H and J) a pin will be displayed ON THE TV that will have to be
entered when prompted to ON YOUR PC.

This program IS NOT the same one that is available on the Python
Packaging Index (Pypi). I do not have access to that and unfortunately
the original author Ape has been on hiatus for some time. He may no
longer be maintaining the library.

So for the time being you will need to clone this repository and
install it using the directions below.

<br></br>
***Dependencies***
------------------

- Python 2.7+
- `websocket-client`
- `requests`
- `pycryptodome`
- `lxml`
- `ifaddr`
- `six`
- `curses` (optional, for the interactive mode)


<br></br>
***Installation***
------------------
```python setup.py install```
<br></br>
It's possible to use the command line tool without installation:
<br></br>
```python -m samsungctl```

<br></br>
***Command line usage***
------------------------

You can use `samsungctl` command to send keys to a TV:
<br></br>
```samsungctl --host <host> [options] <key> [key ...]```
<br></br>
<br></br>
`host` is the hostname or IP address of the TV. `key` is a key code, e.g.
`KEY_VOLDOWN`. See Key codes.

There is also an interactive mode (ncurses) for sending the key presses:
<br></br>
```samsungctl --host <host> [options] --interactive```
<br></br>
<br></br>
Use `samsungctl --help` for more information about the command line
arguments:
<br></br>
```
usage: samsungctl [-h] [--version] [-v] [-q] [-i] [--host HOST] [--port PORT]
                  [--method METHOD] [--name NAME] [--description DESC]
                  [--id ID] [--token TOKEN] [--timeout TIMEOUT]

                  [--contrast CONTRAST] [--sharpness SHARPNESS]
                  [--source SOURCE] [--source-label SOURCE_LABEL]
                  [--config-file PATH/FILENAME]
                  [--start-app APP NAME OR ID] [--app-metadata METADATA]
                  [--key-help]
                  [key [key ...]]

--sharpness SHARPNESS|sets the sharpness allowed values: 0-100 or -1 to print the sharpness
--source SOURCE|set the source. you can use the TV defined names.. HDMI1, HDMI2, PC, USB... or you can use the programmed label that appears on the OSD.
--source-label SOURCE_LABEL|sets the source label that appears on the OSD
--config-file PATH/FILENAME|path and filename to configuration file *see below for mor information
--start-app APPLICATION NAME OR ID|starts an application
--app-metadata METADATA|string of information the application can use when it starts up. And example would be the browser. To have it open directly to a specific URL you would enter: `"http\/\/www.some-web-address.com"` wrapping the meta data in quotes will reduce the possibility of a command line parser error.
--key-help {OPTIONAL KEYS}|prints out key help

<br></br>
Example use:
<br></br>
```
samsungctl --host 192.168.0.10 --name myremote KEY_VOLDOWN
```

<br></br>
To obtain a list of all of the known keys:
<br></br>
```samsungctl --help-keys```
<br></br>

You can also get help on a specific key:
<br></br>
```samsungctl --key-help KEY_16_9```
<br></br>

or if you wanted to list more then one key:
<br></br>
```samsungctl --key-help KEY_16_9 KEY_TTX_MIX```
<br></br>
<br></br>

***--config-file***
___________________
If this is the first time you are using this library on a TV you must
specify --host and key code for the command you wish to execute along
with this parameter.
<br></br>

```samsungctl --host 192.168.1.100 --config-file "/PATH/FILE.NAME" KEY_MENU```
<br></br>

By doing this is will make all of the necessary config file settings that
are needed to be made for your TV. After the library has sent the command
to your TV it will then save the file. Any calls there after will only
need to have --config-file PATH/FILENAME along with the command you
wish to perform for a command line options.
<br></br>

```samsungctl --config-file "/PATH/FILE.NAME" KEY_MENU```
<br></br>

All other information will be retrieved from the file.

<br></br>
<br></br>
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
<br></br>
***depreciated***
<br></br>
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
<br></br>
The settings can be loaded from a configuration file. The file is searched from

* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/samsungctl.conf`
* `~/.config/samsungctl.conf`
* `/etc/samsungctl.conf`

in this order. A simple default configuration is
bundled with the source as

* `samsungctl.conf <samsungctl.conf>`


<br></br>
***Library usage***
-------------------

samsungctl can also be used as a python package.
```python
    import samsungctl
```

A context managed remote controller object of class `Remote` can be
constructed using the `with` statement:

```python
    with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
        # Use the remote object
```

***Config Class***
__________________

I have put into place a class that handles all of the configuration
information. It makes it easier for saving and loading config data.

```python
import samsungctl


config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    description='samsungctl-library',
    method='websocket',
    port=8001
)
```
<br></br>
The constructor for the Config class takes these parameters
<br></br>
I added a new parameter to the config class.
This will allow for user entry of the mac address if there are issues
with detecting it.
<br></br>

Param Name|Default value|Param Type|Use
----------|-------------|----------|---
name|`"samsungctl"`|`str`|Name of the "remote" this is the name that is going to appear on the TV
description|HOSTNAME of local PC|`str`|Only used in the legacy connection (pre 2014  TVs)
host|`None`|`str`|The ip address of the TV `"192.168.1.1"`
port|`None`|`int`|The port to connect to. choices aree 55000 (< 2014), 8080 (2014 & 2015), 8001 & 8002 (>= 2016) or `None` \*
method|`None`|`str`|Connection method \(`"legacy"`, `"websocket"`, `"encrypted"` or `None` \* \)
id|`None`|`str`|This is an identifier that you can set. when using the "encrypted" method this should be left out
timeout|`0`|`int`|socket timeout, only used for the legacy method
token|`None`|`str`|Authentication token that is used for 2014 & 2015 and some 2016+ TV's
device_id|`None`|`str`|Internal Use
upnp_locations|`None`|`list`|Future Use
mac|`None`|`str`|MAC address of the TV `"00:00:00:00:00"` or `None` \*\*.
<br></br>

\* I have instituted a detection system that will automatically detect
what connection type and port to use. In order to have the detection
system activate the port and the method parameters in the call to
Config MUST be `None`.
<br></br>

\*\* The `mac` parameter in the config class does not have to be used if
you are using a legacy connection, <= 2013 TV. if you are using a
TV that is 2014 and newer if there is no mac address the power on
feature will not work. If you do not specify a mac address and the TV
is 2014 or newer the program will attempt to acquire the MAC address of
the TV for you. in order for this to be successful you need to have
your TV turned on. This process only needs to be done a single time if
you are saving the configuration data using the `save` method. If for
some reason we are unable to locate the MAC address for the TV you have
the option of manually passing it to the call to Config. If you are
entering it manually it needs to be formatted `"00:00:00:00:00"`.
<br></br>

Here is a python script example of running samsungctl using all of the
detection features activated remember in order for this to work you
need to have the TV powered on. Since we only want to go through this
process a single time (because it can take an extra second or 2) we want
to save the configuration information to file. So be sure to enter the
path and filename into the save method.
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl


config = samsungctl.Config(host='192.168.1.100')

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
    remote.KEY_MENU()

config.save('PATH/FILE.NAME')

```
<br></br>

the Config class is also where you set your logging level
<br></br>

```python
import logging
import samsungctl


config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

config.log_level = logging.DEBUG
```
<br></br>

There are 2 nice convenience methods for saving and loading a config file.
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl

config = samsungctl.Config.load('path/to/save/file')
```
<br></br>

If you load a file the path is saved so you can simply call save to
save any new data. If you constructed the Config class manually you will
need to pass a path when calling save. and that path is then saved so
any subsequent calls to save will not require you to pass the path
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl


config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    description='samsungctl-library',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

config.save('path/to/save/file')
```
<br></br>

when calling save if you pass only a folder path and not a folder/file path
the name you passed to the constructor will be used along with the
extension ".config"
<br></br>

You do not need to keep track of the config instance. once it is passed
to the Remote constructor it is then stored in that instance.
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl


config = samsungctl.Config.load('path/to/save/file')
remote = samsungctl.Remote(config)
remote.config.save()
```
<br></br>

I also gave a little twist on the loading of the config file. I did
this so there would not need to be 2 different code blocks one for
initial setup and another for loading a saved file.
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl

config = samsungctl.Config.load('PATH/FILE.NAME')(
    name='samsungctl',
    description='samsungctl-library',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

config.save()

```
<br></br>

The nifty thing about the code above is it allows for several things to happen
1. It is not going to require 2 different config setup routines. only a single one is needed. If the file exists then it is used.
2. If you happen to only specify a directory and want samsungctl to use the name parameter for the filename. this is what makes that possible.
3. If the path does not exist. then it will create a new configuration with the supplied arguments and set the save of that config data.
<br></br>
<br></br>
You are still able to pass a dictionary to the Remote constructor as well.
<br></br>
<br></br>

***\*\*\* Depreciated***
The constructor takes a configuration dictionary as a parameter. All
configuration items must be specified.

<br></br>

Key|Type|Description
---|----|-----------
host|string|Hostname or IP address of the TV.
port|int|TCP port number. \(Default: `55000`\)
method|string|Connection method \(`"legacy"` or `"websocket"`\)
name|string|Name of the remote controller.
description|string|Remote controller description.
id|string|Additional remote controller ID.
token|string|Authentication token
timeout|int|Timeout in seconds. `0` means no timeout.
<br></br>

***Power Property***
____________________
Power status along with powering off and on 2014+ TV's

<br></br>
```python
import samsungctl


config = samsungctl.Config.load('path/to/save/file')
remote = samsungctl.Remote(config)
print(remote.power)

# turns the TV on
remote.power = True

print(remote.power)
# turns the TV off
remote.power = False

# toggles the power
remote.power = not remote.power
```
<br></br>

We do not have the ability to turn on the TV's older then 2014.
<br></br>
<br></br>

***Exceptions***
________________
When something goes wrong you will receive an exception:
<br></br>

Exception|Description
---------|-----------
SamsungTVError|Samsung TV Exception Base Class.
AccessDenied|Connection was denied.
ConnectionClosed|Connection was closed.
UnhandledResponse|Received unknown response.
NoTVFound|Unable to locate a TV.
ConfigError|Base class for config exceptions.
ConfigUnknownMethod|Unknown connection method.
ConfigParseError|Config data is not json formatted or is not a formatted flat file.
ConfigLoadError|Config path specified cannot be located.
ConfigSavePathError|Config save path is not valid.
ConfigSaveError|Error saving config.
ConfigSavePathNotSpecified|Config save path was not specified.
ConfigParameterError|Parameter is not a config parameter.
<br></br>

***Example program***
_____________________
This simple program opens and closes the menu a few times.
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl
import time

config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='legacy',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
    for i in range(10):
        remote.control("KEY_MENU")
        time.sleep(0.5)
```
<br></br>

***Mouse Control***
___________________
Mouse control can only be done by using samsungctl as a python module.
Mouse command are built. this way you can accomplish multiple movements
in a single "command" and the movement set can be stored for later use.
depending on how long it takes to accomplish a movement
(distance traveled) you will need to insert a wait period in between
each movement.
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl

config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
    mouse = remote.mouse
    mouse.move(x=100, y=300)
    mouse.wait(0.5)
    mouse.left_click()
    mouse.run()
    mouse.clear()
```
<br></br>

I designed this to all be thread safe. so only one mouse command set
can be run at a single time. So if you have the mouse running in a
thread and you need to stop the movement from another. or you simply
want to terminate the program gracefully. you would call `mouse.stop()`
<br></br>

I will be at a later date adding the wait periods on the mouse movements
so it will be done automatically. I do not own one of the TV's so I do
not know how long it takes to move the mouse different distances. I
also do not know if the time it takes to move the mouse is linear. An
example of linear movement would be it takes 1 second to move the
mouse 100 pixels so to move it 200 pixels it would take 2 seconds.
most devices that have mouse control also have acceleration and a
min/max speed which would be non linear movement. An example of non
linear is, if it took 1 second to move the mouse 100 pixels, to move it
200 it would take 1.5 seconds. You can run the code below and report
the output to me. that will aide in making this all automatic. I need
this data form several TV models and years. as Samsung could have
changed the mouse speed and acceleration between years/models.
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl
import time


config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
     mouse = remote.mouse

    def move_mouse(_x, _y):
        mouse.move(x=x, y=y)
        start = time.time()
        mouse.run()
        stop = time.time()
        print('x:', x, 'y:', y, 'time:', (stop - start) * 1000)
        mouse.clear()
        mouse.move(x=-x, y=-y)
        mouse.run()
        mouse.clear()

    for x in range(1920):
        move_mouse(x, 0)

        for y in range(1080):
            move_mouse(0, y)
            move_mouse(x, y)
```
<br></br>

***Voice Recognition***
_______________________
If you TV supports voice recognition you have the ability to start and
stop the voice recognition service on the TV. this can be done only by
using the samsungctl library as a package to an already existing program.
example code of how to do this is below.
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl
import time

config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
    remote.start_voice_recognition()
    time.sleep(5.0)
    remote.stop_voice_recognition()
```
<br></br>

***Applications***
__________________
This is going to be a wee bit long winded. But here goes
<br></br>

below is a sample of how to access the applications on the TV
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl

config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
    for app in remote.applications:
        print('name:', app.name)
        print('=' * 30)
        print('id:', app.app_id)
        print('is running:', app.is_running)
        print('version:', app.version)
        print()
```
<br></br>

if you want to access a specific application by name or by the app id
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl

config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
    app = remote.get_application('YouTube')
    if app is not None:
        print('name:', app.name)
        print('=' * 30)
        print('id:', app.app_id)
        print('is running:', app.is_running)
        print('version:', app.version)
        print()
```
<br></br>

these are the available properties for an application

* is_lock
* name
* app_type
* position
* app_id
* launcher_type
* mbr_index
* source_type_num
* icon
* id
* mbr_source
* action_type
* version
* is_visible
* is_running

<br></br>
now here is a little bonus. we can also iterate over an application for
any content groups. and then we can iterate over the content group for
the available content in that group
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl

config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
    for app in remote.applications:
        print('name:', app.name)
        print('=' * 30)
        for content_group in app:
            print('   ', content_group.title)
            print('   ', '-' * 26)
            for content in content_group:
                print('       ', content.title)
```
<br></br>

here are the available properties for the content group

* title

<br></br>
here are the available properties for the content

* is_playable
* subtitle
* app_type
* title
* mbr_index
* live_launcher_type
* action_play_url
* service_id
* launcher_type
* source_type_num
* action_type
* app_id
* subtitle2
* display_from
* display_until
* mbr_source
* id
* subtitle3
* icon

<br></br>

You can also run an application or a piece of content by calling `run()`
on either an application or on the content.
<br></br>

<br></br>
Please note that some codes are different on the 2016+ TVs. For example,
`KEY_POWEROFF` is `KEY_POWER` on the newer TVs.
<br></br>

I also added all of the keys as methods. so you have the choice of using
the method for sending a key
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl

config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
    remote.command("KEY_VOLUP")

```
<br></br>

or you can also use this
<br></br>

```python
import samsungctl

config = samsungctl.Config(
    name='samsungctl',
    method='websocket',
    host='192.168.1.100'
)

with samsungctl.Remote(config) as remote:
    remote.KEY_VOLUP()

```
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>

***References***
----------------

I did not reverse engineer the control protocol myself and samsungctl is not
the only implementation. Here is the list of things that inspired samsungctl.
